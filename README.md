## Source code for https://betweenreality.github.io/

Uses Jekyll as a static site generator (mostly to prevent code duplication)

The site uses an "Unobtrusive JavaScript" approach, meaning everything important can be seen entirely without javascript. Any javascript used is only for minimal stuff which would be impossible otherwise, or to fix hacky HTML methods
