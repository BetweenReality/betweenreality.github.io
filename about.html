                        <p>I am mainly a "Source Engine Modder", but I mean that in more of a general sense. As in, I know a lot about it overall and I could make a whole campaing if I spent the time on it (though the one thing I never got into was actually modding the engine itself at a code level (and by that I mean readable compilable code)). Anyways I can also do many other things, each with varying skill level. Some I am much better at and have more experience with, while others I only know partially. A Jack of All Trades or a One-Man Army, if you will. Historically I have been working alone for all my projects and thus I have had to learn every skill required to fulfill the tasks specified by each of them. I like this quote from "Freemans Mind", it sums it up pretty well:</p>
                        <blockquote cite="https://youtu.be/3jkhTDypVjw">
                            “What? Why is he not dead yet?? Do I have to kill everyone around here myself?! … I can't delegate anything. You know, being a one-man army isn't actually something you aspire to. You say that because it sounds badass, not because you <i>literally</i> want to function as an entire army! But what are my options?! Do everything myself, or just die! My opinion of humanity is so low right now. or maybe not humanity, but, everything.”

                        </blockquote>
                        <p>Okay maybe that's a bit extreme of a comparison (it would be more accurate in a Warzone) but the point is that I never really had any other options so I simply did what I had to.</p>
                        Anyways ere is a list of a subset of these skills (Semi-ordered based on skill level):
                        <ul>
                            <li>Level Design and Environment Design (Mapping)</li>

                            <li>3D Modeler (Mesh creation, sculpting, UV unwrapping, Texturing)</li>
                            <li>UI Design (Desktop, Web)</li>

                        </ul>
                        <p>My most knowledgeable of these skills are definitely Mapping and Programming. I would say maybe Mapping actually comes first (as a surprise even to me), which is proven through my 3x streak of winning every PMaM MicroComp in Season 1. The reason I am surprised is because although I started mapping somewhere around 7 - 10 years ago, I haven't actually mapped much during that time. I mean, I have mapped a lot but most of it was working on random, more beginner-esque projects that never really ended up anywhere because I made them more for myself than anything, and after that point my mapping was much more scarce and scattered. In recent years I started mapping more "real" stuff but again it was still very limited, so it surprised me that I could just go out and make maps with tons of detail in styles I've never tried before, and in certain cases, that I've never even seen before.</p>
                        <p>Anyways, I learned programming by myself mainly a couple years ago, and I would like to think I am decent but I know well that I have so much more to learn (Something something Dunning–Kruger Effect). The same can be said about Reverse-Engineering except I know even less about that. I'm surprised I was even able to accomplish what I did with dll editing.</p>
                        <p>As for the rest, the stories behind them probably aren't worth talking about, I guess apart from the last three which are notably prefixed with "Not Yet". Those (or at least majorly the first two) I have been meaning to learn for a secret project I've been working on, which by nature of being secret I can't say much more about it.</p>

                        <p>This website is the hub for all my publicly known projects and other activities</p>
                        <p>All main site functionality runs on pure HTML and CSS with no javascript, meaning the experience should be essentially identical if you have it off in your browser (I only use javascript when absolutely necessary, otherwise I avoid it if I can.) That might mean I have to do some strange hacks in the "code" but if it works it works.</p>
                        <p>You may have also noticed that the main cuboid thing icon subtly changes depending on what page you are on. These icon variants actually have a specific meaning, and you may have picked up on it if you really paid attention. If you haven't however, here is a listing of all of them and what they coorespond to:</p>

                                <h3 class="logo-image-title">Logo 3</h3>

                            <div class="logo-image-container">
                                <h3 class="logo-image-title">Logo 6</h3>
                                <div class="logo-image-title">Special Case</div>
                                <img class="image-border" src="media/images/page/logo_6.png" width="128" height="128" alt="logo_6.png">
                            </div>
                        </div>
                        <p>Most of these should be self-explanatory, apart from "Special Case". Originally it was essentially unused and I decided it would be for anything else that doesn't fit the other 3 categories, but as I was writing this I remembered that I had some beta pages on this site that aren't ready yet but I still published (for those of you curious enough to find them). That sounded like a perfect fit for "Special Case", and so that is it's new usage.</p>
                        <p>As for their numbering, it is based on the number of edges created when the shape was cut out of the cube. For -1 the resulting cutout is round so it could be said that the edge count is infinite, but I went with a simpler number for text formatting reasons.</p>
                        <p>Apart from these I also made another version with a 9-edge cutout, but I didn't like how it looked since the others had a nicer symmetry with the cube's geometry. Specifically, The hexagon and triangle can be made nicely from an intersecting plane, and the "curved" one is essentially just a variant of the triangle, or alternatively, you could say that the 9-side variant is one step closer to approaching the curved version as well (for n-edges as n approaches infinity). So rather than include all possible cutouts past the first 2 nice ones (3 and 6), we may as well just use the infinite one instead. Here it is anyway though:</p>

                            <div class="logo-image-container">
                                <h3 class="logo-image-title">Logo 9</h3>
                                <div class="logo-image-title">Unused</div>
                                <img class="image-border" src="media/images/page/logo_9.png" width="128" height="128" alt="logo_9.png">
                            </div>
                        </div>
                        <p>There's also the scenario of changing how many vertices are "anchored" when you approach infinity, but in our case the geometry of the cube limits that to a hard 3 no matter what. With some careful modeling I suppose you could create an interesting curve with more anchored points, but I don't think that would look right, the same as the 9-edge variant. This is why I only finalized the main 4 above, they were simply the nicest ones you could make given the geometry of a cube.</p>
