# NOTE: livereload doesn't work with localhost for whatever reason
#  Additionally, livereload doesn't work if there isn't any *.markdown or *.md files in the repo. ???
#  TODO: â†‘ This also generates a useless html file though that can be accessed
#  NOTE: Actually it just seems like livereload decides to not work randomly sometimes. Amazing.
#  NOTE: Actually actually it looks like it stops working when there is an error in the liquid code, but it decides to just not say anything in the output unless I fully reload the server

# NOTE: This makes the page open twice, I think setting livereload to true also opens a page?

# HACK: Set include directory to root, because include_relative doesn't accept "../" so this allows us to use any directory we want
