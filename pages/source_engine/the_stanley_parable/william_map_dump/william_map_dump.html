    <p>On 2024-10-08 William from the Crows Crows Crows Discord Server randomly released a bunch of beta TSP:HDR content such as screenshots, but more notably a pack full of a bunch of raw development VMFs. These contained many beta versions of current day maps, as well as a lot of other tests and unused areas. The map pack didn't include every known map from development, but it likely contains a large portion of them. It doesn't include any assets however, although William has said he would release the Beta Builds of the game once he looks them over. He has yet to release them to this day, but he confirmed he didn't forget about them on 2024-11-13.</p>
