        Want to ask me a question? Hire me for some project? Hire me for real money? Some other crazy scenario? Then here's how to do it<br>
        <br>
        Currently the best way to contact me is via Discord: <a href="https://discord.com/users/1018960364790095972">@BetweenReality</a><br>
        Alternatively you could try <a href="https://github.com/BetweenReality">Github</a>, <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/id/BetweenReality/">Steam</a> or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmZSzK7eHVIGG7qUH2I74DQ">Youtube</a> but I would say those are worse options<br>
        <br>
        Eventually I plan to get an email here too but I need to do some things first before I can just reveal one to the world
