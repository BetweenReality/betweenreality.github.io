            <p>My Primary Alias is "BetweenReality", though some like to shorten it to just "Between", "Reality", or "BR", for convenience sake. I plan to eventually change this as I don't think it's unique enough (in terms of the actual words. Lexically it appears decently unique among the places I've used it as a username). It's especially non-unique when people use the shortenings and it's also a bit long to begin with, so not ideal. There's also another reason but I can't disclose that yet, though it's not that important anyway.</p>
            <p>One other thing to mention before I start, yeah I'm religious. If you don't like that then that's not my problem, but I won't hate you regardless. I'm not here to hate people arbitrarily over the smallest of issues, and in fact don't hate anyone in general. Like GLaDOS once said,
            <blockquote cite="https://combineoverwiki.net/wiki/GLaDOS/Quotes/Portal_2_single-player">
                “<b>Luckily I'm a bigger person than that. I'm happy to put this all behind us and get back to work.</b> After all, we've got a lot to do, and only sixty more years to do it. More or less. I don't have the actuarial tables in front of me.”

            Anyways if you find yourself hating people, take a second to reflect on how that decision affects you, because often it is unnecessary and useless and harboring hatred or grudges for long periods of time only makes things worse for yourself. Though I am in no place to force you to do anything, I am just providing my perspective. Of course I'm obviously on the side of my own beliefs and would hope people change, but ultimately that decision is up to them. Everyone decides their own fate, after all.</p>
            <p>Now that that's out of the way, here's some actual information</p>
            <p>Basic Info:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Catholic</li>
                <li>Jack of All Trades (Master of none)</li>
                <li>Source Engine Mapper / Modder</li>
                <li>Project Never-Revealer (and Take-Foreverer)</li>
                <li>Bound to secrecy of my own creation</li>
            </ul>
            <p>I am mainly a "Source Engine Modder" in a general sense. As in, I know a lot about the engine overall and I could make a whole campaing if I spent the time on it (though the one thing I never got into was actually modding the engine itself at a code level (and by that I mean readable, compilable code)). Anyways I can also do many other things, each with varying skill level. Some I am much better at and have more experience with, while others I only know partially. A Jack of All Trades, or a One-Man Army, if you will. Historically I have been working alone for all my projects and thus I have had to learn every skill required to fulfill the tasks specified by each of them. I like this quote from "Freemans Mind", it sums it up pretty well:</p>
            <blockquote cite="https://youtu.be/3jkhTDypVjw">
                “What? Why is he not dead yet? Do I have to kill everyone around here myself?! … I can't delegate anything. You know, being a one-man army isn't actually something you aspire to. You say that because it sounds badass, not because you <i>literally</i> want to function as an entire army! But what are my options?! Do everything myself, or just die! My opinion of humanity is so low right now. Or maybe not humanity, but, everything.”

            </blockquote>
            <p>Okay maybe that's a bit extreme of a comparison (it would be more accurate in a Warzone) but the point is that I never really had any other options, so I simply did what I had to.</p>
            Anyways here is a list of a subset of these skills (Semi-ordered based on skill level):
            <ul>
                <li>Level Design and Environment Design (Mapping)</li>
                <li>Programming (C, C++, Python, Java, Javascript)</li>
                <li>Reverse-Engineering (x86, ARM via Ghidra)</li>
                <li>Testing (Debugging, Playtesting)</li>
                <li>3D Modelling (Mesh creation, sculpting, UV unwrapping, Texturing, CAD)</li>
                <li>UI Design (Desktop, Web)</li>
                <li>Writing (General scripts, refined stories)</li>
                <li>Composing (Musician)</li>
                <li>Artist (Textures, Concepts, General)</li>
                <li>(Not Yet) Actual Artist (Drawing)</li>
                <li>(Not Yet) Animator (2D, 3D)</li>
                <li>(Not Yet) Voice Actor (Temporary)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>My most knowledgeable of these skills are definitely Mapping and Programming. I would say Mapping maybe actually comes first (as a surprise even to me), which was proven through my 3x streak of winning every PMaM MicroComp in Season 1. The reason I'm surprised is because although I started mapping somewhere around 7 - 10 years ago, I haven't actually "mapped" much during that time. I mean, I have mapped a lot but most of it was working on random, more beginner-esque projects that never really ended up anywhere because I made them more for myself than anything, and after that point my mapping was much more scarce and scattered. In recent years I started mapping more "real" stuff but even then it was still very limited. So it surprised me that I could just go out and make maps with tons of detail in styles I've never tried before, and in certain cases, that I've never even seen before, and have people actually like them.</p>
            <p>Anyways on to programming, I learned it myself mainly a couple years ago, and I would like to think I am decent but I know well that I have so much more to learn (Something something Dunning–Kruger Effect). The same can be said about Reverse-Engineering except I know even less about that. In fact I'm surprised I was even able to accomplish what I did with dll editing (It's a mess in there).</p>
            <p>As for the rest, the stories behind them probably aren't worth talking about, I guess apart from the last three which are notably prefixed with "Not Yet". Those (or at least majorly the first two) I have been meaning to learn for a secret project I've been working on, which by nature of being secret I can't say much more about it.</p>

        <section class="shadow-box">
            <h1 class="title-centered">About the Site</h1>
            <p>This website is the hub for all my publicly known projects and other activities. I suppose it also acts as a portfolio inadvertently. I originally used it to showcase some work I did to prove I was capable to the Portal 2: Community Edition team (because they are super strict about who gets access for some reason), but since then this has evolved to be a general showcase instead, as well as anything else I may want to put here.</p>
            <br>
            <h2>Code</h2>
            <p>All main site functionality runs on pure HTML and CSS with no javascript (...mostly. I still use some minor javascript for some inconsequential unnecessary stuff that would be impossible otherwise, and external embeds that require it (I'm looking at you YouTube)). That might mean I have to do some strange hacks in the "code" at times but if it works it works.</p>
            <p>My main reason for this is because I hate it when websites use javascript for absolutely everything. That slows down loading speeds significantly and wastes computing power for no reason, and most of the time they are probably doing other garbage with it becaues of course they would. I turn off javascript by default and it's always so dumb when a page is just completely blank unless I enable it. Back in the day people optimized their websites to no end because you only had some kilobytes of download speed max, but now that we are in the future I guess everyone decided that they missed the loading speeds of the past so they wanted to bring it back. It's a similar scenario to optimization in games I'd say, especially with prebuilt engines.</p>
            <p>Anyways what that means is that you don't need javascript to see any of this. Feel free to turn it off even, it pretty much won't make a difference. In fact you should just go ahead and turn it off everywhere by default (like me) to stop dumb websites from doing dumb things that they don't need to be doing. Oh and while you're at it you should also get UBlock Origin to block the rest of the garbage that all these loaded websites like piling on (stuff like dumb scripts and trackers and ads). You might need a firefox-based browser though, I think Chromium browsers finally killed it because it does something useful and Google can't have that.</p>
            <p>In other news I have also switched to using Jekyll as a static site generator because I didn't like how much copy-pasting I had to do for every page (And Github Pages doesn't really allow for anything that would help in that regard). It saves me time and integrates well with Github Pages so it was the best option. Kinda a pain to setup on my end because I was making it harder for myself, but really I blame Windows because it would have been simpler on Linux (and more to my liking). Yes I use Windows by the way, but it kinda really sucks, but I'm also too lazy to switch because it would be a bunch of work to set everything up properly so I'm stuck with it for now. There's also the whole scenario of Windows-exclusive programs but that's a whole other topic. Anyways, Jekyll is meant for Blogs technically and this website isn't a blog, however it has a lot of other useful features so I just ignore the blog-specific stuff. I actually went overboard and already started pushing it to it's limits by trying to get the output formatted correctly using only Liquid code which kinda works, but ultimately it's completely useless pretty much and there are better ways to do that. As of writing this the website code still uses that inefficient method. I'm rambling now though so let's move on.</p>
            <br>
            <h2>Theme</h2>
            <p>The site theme was made entirely by me from scratch. It's not the most amazing or intricate or modern thing ever but it's mostly cohesive at least. The No-Javascript rule also prevents me from doing anything too fancy anyways though.</p>
            <p>I originally designed the base concept of the theme for something completely unrelated that I won't get into yet. At the time it was simpler and less efficient but that's because it didn't really need to be much. Now that I am reusing it for this I put more care into it, though some residual stuff from that time is still present in the code as of writing this.</p>
            <p>If you look at the background here you will see a noise pattern (well not "pattern" by definition but you get it). Originally I created that I think purely to fill the space better than a solid color could. It adds detail for free basically, but I also liked how it looked so I kept going with it. The noise itself originally started as raw images for each color, then it transitioned to a single image that was tinted, and then finally into an SVG that generates the noise automatically. The SVG may or may not be more efficient than the second method (both are decently fast regardless), but the SVG method is more reusable and modifyable so I'm sticking with it for now. It also prevents the noise pattern from repeating since it's not just a single image (though that was not too noticable anyway).</p>
            <br>
            <h2>Logo</h2>
            <p>The logo is also a remnant from that original use case I mentioned earlier. I created it because I felt like I needed something to spice the page up, so I came up with this geometric cuboid shape thing design. At first I made it simply in a raster image editor, but later I turned it into a full 3D model because it would be easier to deal with. As opposed to raster or even vector images, a 3D model allows me to change the actual shape better since it is actually 3D instead of faking it, and it also allows me to easily change the shading and lighting if I need to.</p>
            <p>You may have also noticed that the cuboid icon thing subtly changes depending on what page you are on. These icon variants actually have a specific meaning, and you may have picked up on it if you really pay attention. If you haven't however, here is a listing of all of them and what they coorespond to:</p>

                        <div class="logo-image-subtitle">Special Case</div>
                    </figcaption>

                </figure>
            </figure>
            <p>Most of these should be self-explanatory, apart from "Special Case". Originally it was essentially unused and I decided it would be for anything else that doesn't fit the other 3 categories, but as I was writing this I remembered that I had some beta pages on this site that aren't ready yet but I still published (for those of you curious enough to find them). That sounded like a perfect fit for "Special Case", and so that's it's new usage.</p>
            <p>As for their numbering, it's based on the number of edges created when the shape was cut out of the cube. For -1 the resulting cutout is round so technically it could be said that the edge count is infinite (or 0 but that is taken), but I went with a simpler number for text formatting reasons.</p>
            <p>Apart from these I also made another version with a 9-edge cutout, but I didn't like how it looked since the others had a nicer symmetry with the cube's geometry. Specifically, a hexagon and triangle can be made nicely from an intersecting plane (The actual shapes are just derivative from this approach), and the "curved" one is essentially just a variant of the triangle. Alternatively you could say that the 9-side variant is one step closer to approaching the curved version (for n-edges as n approaches infinity). So rather than include all possible cutouts past the first 2 nice ones (3 and 6), we may as well just use the infinite one instead. Here it is anyway though:</p>
            <figure class="logo-image-container">
                <figcaption class="logo-image-title">Logo 9</figcaption>
                <figcaption class="logo-image-subtitle">Unused</figcaption>
                <img class="image-border" src="/media/images/page/logos/logo_9.png" width="128" height="128" alt="logo_9.png">
            </figure>
            <p>There's also the scenario of changing how many vertices are "anchored" when you approach infinity, but in our case the geometry of the cube limits that to a hard 3 no matter what. With some careful modeling I suppose you could create an interesting curve with more anchored points, but I don't think that would look right, the same as the 9-edge variant. In fact the 9-edge variant already appears to have a different curve-profile to it's supposed limit of the -1 variant. This is why I only finalized the main 4 above, they were simply the nicest ones you could make given the geometry of a cube. Perhaps there is some alternative geometry other than these cutouts I could attempt, but for the moment I don't need any more so the main 4 stay.</p>
            <!-- TODO: Add pictures here -->
            <h2>Other Logos</h2>
            <p>Aside from the main logos there is also that strange shape thing in the background of the main page. That thing I made back when I programmed a simple Discord bot (Officially called BR-AI or BR-BOT) that utilized a self-hosted LLM. It turned out to be way too slow and jank to work well so I didn't do much with it, but I made that shape to use as the bot's profile picture and background. It's basically just an XYZ axis representation embedded in some abstract cuboid thing.</p>
            <p>Then there's my own profile pictures. Originally they were just glowing green 3D characters with the first letter being the first initial of either my current username or the platform it was being used on, while the second number indicated the "Phase" (For now it's secret what that means). So for example, my original Discord username was "Named", and the phase was 1, so the profile picture was just a 3D green "N1". Nowadays I have moved on from the letter variants and now have this mirror-room abstract cube thing, in which the small attached cubes represent the phase instead.</p>
