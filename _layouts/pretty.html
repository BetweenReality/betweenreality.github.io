    "prettify.html" is a top-level layout designed to prettify the jekyll _site output files
    Normally when including a file Jekyll puts the contents in raw, making no attempt to match the current indentation. This fixes that and applies the proper indentation to the output
    This is purely cosmetic (or for easier debugging of the output) and is otherwise functionally identical to using regular includes
    
    To Use:
        Inherit this layout in your layout
        All include files must have these two markers added to them:
            ~+~ at the top, and ~-~ at the bottom. Both must have no leading or trailing whitespace and must be completely on their own lines
    
    Make sure to also use whitespace control on the Liquid you have in your html files for further prettiness
    As a baseline:
        - Always use whitespace control for tags that are at the end of a line
        - Do not add whitespace control to one-line if statements that add / remove a piece of HTML. This will generate a blank line, which this script will remove
    You might need more or less whitespace control to get the output you want depending on the structure of your code
    
    WORKAROUND: Is there any way to detect includes without needing to manually add the markers?
    
    I feel like both methods for indentation-correction have their own benefits and drawbacks
    This method lets you write everything like normal, except basically every file that isn't a layout needs markers added to the beginning and end. That's useful since you only ever need to add the markers as if it was builtin syntax and that's all, but now there is the additional overhead of needing to do that for every new file you create (that isn't a layout). This one is also more complex code-wise, needing to calculate the indentation itself
    The other method forces you to instead modify the include syntax and manually input the indentation amount (which might change if the page changes so you would have to modify this number again yourself), but it leaves everything else alone. It's also not perfect and in some edge cases it doesn't work fully.
    Ultimately I think the original method is better since I don't use includes as much as I make new files, since I only really ever use includes in layouts and for notices, and it isn't too often that I modify or use those.
